## The Project

The idea of this app is originated from a homework that I decide
to take further for practicing how to build web apps using ruby
only, build using Sinatra. The app counts with a database
(Postgres) that holds the input from the user. The idea is
pretty simple. The app allows you to build your planet. It works
with the possibility for the user to add an image that is
“converted” into a planet. The greatest challenge at the time
was to learn how to use params and how to use it for styling
purposes and data manipulation.
